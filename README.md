# Glslify webpack boilerplate

A basic setup for playing with shaders in webgl using the amazing [glslify](https://github.com/glslify/glslify) library.

`npm start` will run the server and point your browser to the index, which should show a baboon rendered on a webgl texture. Hot reload is set up so any changes in javascript/shader code will propagate automatically.
